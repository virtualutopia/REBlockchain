# REBlockchain
The smart conrtact is developed in REMIX using Solidity language.
The main function is "certification"(it needs "msg.sender address" as input). Basically it checks whether all the requirements of a certificate are satisfied before issuing it. if not we will receive an exeption saying which reqirment has not yet provided. Then one needs to run the related function using the "msg.sender address" as input. 
you may input a bytes32 of previous block data using "firstfunction".
The output is a hash of all the previous data and new data.
